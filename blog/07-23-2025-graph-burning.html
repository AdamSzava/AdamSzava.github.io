        <h2>Burning Paths</h2>
        <p><em>Posted on: 07-23-2025</em></p>

        <p>Today we look in detail at the proof of the following known fact about burning paths.</p>
        <div class="proposition">
            <strong>Proposition:</strong> $$b(P_n) = \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$$
        </div>

        <p><em>Proof:</em></p>
        <p>Let $(x_1,\dots, x_k)$ be an optimal burning 
            sequence of $P_n$ (also label the vertices of $P_n$ as $(v_1,\dots, v_n$). This proof is broken into showing there is some strategy in which $k = \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$ and that in general $k \geq \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$.
            From this we can conclude that $b(P_n) = \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$.
        </p>
<hr>
        <p><em>$k \geq \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$:</em></p>
        <p>We begin our discussion by proving the lower bound on the length of the optimal burning sequence. Informally, if we can show that 
        $b(P_n) \geq k$ we are saying that it couldn't take any less rounds than $k$, but we are not sure if it can actually be done in $k$ rounds.</p>

        To this effect, we know if the game takes $k$ rounds to finish, then $k$ sources are chosen. We consider what is the maximum possible coverage of
        burning spread from these $k$ sources at the end of $k$ rounds, this assumes ideal choices for sources with no overlap. Naturally, if we can show under these conditions
        the game must still take at least $ \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$ rounds, then that is a lower bound for the burning number.

        <p> <ul>
            <li>The first source $x_1$ in the burning sequence will be responsible for burning itself $(1)$, and then $k-1$ (this is how many rounds are left)
            more nodes in either direction along the path ($2(k-1)$), so in total it will be responsible for burning $2(k-1)+1$ vertices.</li>
            <li>So, we can say in general that $x_i$ will be responsible for burning $2(k-i)+1$ vertices in the path.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This includes the last round where the final source is only responsible for burning itself. Indeed $2(k-k) + 1 = 1$.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        So this means under ideal conditions where there is no overburning, we have that the total number of nodes burned after $k$ rounds is:
        $$\sum_{i = 1}^k [2(k-i)+1] = \cdots = k^2$$
        ... where I skipped over the algebra (simple application of well known formulas for finite series). Well we want this to burn the whole graph, so it better be at least $n$ (the number of nodes in the path).
        $$k^2 \geq n \implies k \geq \sqrt{n} \implies k \geq \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$$.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p><em>A valid burning sequence of length $k = \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$:</em></p>
        In the previous part of the proof we showed that it could take no less than $\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$ rounds to finish burning a path, but to show
        the equality we want, now we need to provide an actual strategy for burning the path that takes $\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$ rounds, from which we can conclude $b(G) \leq \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$.

        <p>We define $k=\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$ values for $x_i$ one for each $i$ in $0 \leq i \leq k-2$ and then separately we define $x_1$.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We start at the end of the path and move left. We know that $x_k$ will be reponsible for burning just a single node in the final round, so make it the rightmost one $v_n$. Therefore: $$x_k = v_n$$ </li>
            <li>The next-to-last source $x_{k-1}$ is responsible for burning $3$ nodes: itself, and spread to $2$ nodes in either direction. It must not be the one directly before $v_n$ (as in, $v_{n-1}$) because then it would spread to burn $v_n$ in the next round. 
                So instead $$x_{k-1} = v_{n-2}$$</li>
            <li>Let's do one more... $x_{k-2}$ will burn $5$ nodes in the path, notably it spreads the burning $2$ hops towards $x_{k-1}$, while $x_{k-1}$ will spread similarly by $1$ hop towards $x_{k-2}$ by the end of the game.
                For this logic it is not enough for them to be $1$ node apart like in the previous case, but they need an additional $2$ spaces between them to spread (one from each source). Therefore:
                $$x_{k-2} = v_{n-6}$$
            </li>
            <li>We continue this pattern, each time the sources should be an additional $2$ hops apart. In general this means that ($\forall 0 \leq i \leq k-2$):
                $$x_{k-i} = v_{n- \sum_{m=0}^i 2m}= v_{n- i^2-i}$$
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally we need to pick $x_1$... using the scheme above we could pick $x_1 = x_{k-(k-1)} = v_{n - (k-1)^2-(k-1)}$. But the problem is that $n - (k-1)^2-(k-1)$ could be less than $1$ (check: show that a similar problem could not occur for $x_2$). If this is not the case, then go ahead with
                that choice of $x_1$. If we have that $n - (k-1)^2-(k-1) < 1 \iff n < (k-1)^2+k$, then just pick $x_1 = v_1$.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Okay, we have explained how to find the $k$ elements of the burning sequence $(x_1,\dots, x_k)$, but we need to still show it is a valid burning sequence. This can be done via the following theorem:</p>
        <div class="theorem">
            <strong>Theorem 4.2:</strong> Let $G$ be a graph and $k$ a positive integer. A sequence of vertices $(x_1,\dots, x_k)$ is a burning sequence for $G$ if, and only if, the following holds:
            $$N_{k-1}[x_1] \cup N_{k-2}[x_2] \cup \cdots \cup N_{0}[x_k] = V(G)$$
            ... where $N_d[v] := \{ u \in V(G) : d(u,v) \leq d \} \cup \{ v\}$
        </div>
        
        <p>Indeed, this is true by construction. For all $i$ we have that $N_{i}[x_{k-i}]$ is an "interval" of length $2i+1$, and the collection of these intervals are (by design) pairwise disjoint, and cover all of $V(G)$.
            The only detail to consider is what happens when $x_1 = v_1$, but in such a case we just introduce a small overlap between the burning radii of $x_1$ and $x_2$ (which is fine, it still does the job in $k$ rounds).
        </p>

        <hr>

        We complete the proof by combining the above two results to conclude that:
        $$b(P_n) = \lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$$
        ... as desired.
