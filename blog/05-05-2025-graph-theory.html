        <div class="proposition">
            <strong>Proposition:</strong> For a tree $T$ of order at least $2$, $T$ contains a node of degree $1$.
        </div>
        
        <p>Before the proof, let's mention a few definitions...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A graph $G$ is a tree if it is connected and acyclic (has no subgraph isomorphic to $C_n$ for any $n \geq 3$).</li>
            <li>A node of degree $1$ is called a leaf.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's also mention why we need the order to be at least $2$...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If $T$ is a tree of order $0$ then it is the empty graph, which clearly contains no leaves (since it contains no nodes!).</li>
            <li>If $T$ is a tree of order $1$ then it is isomorphic to $K_1$. There is only one node in $K_1$ and it is not a leaf (it has degree $0$).</li> 
        </ul>

        <p><em>Proof:</em></p>

        <p>Suppose $T = (V(T),E(T))$ is a tree of order at least $2$. We can find some path $P$ in $T$ such that $P$ is maximal in terms of length (number of nodes).
        Let $P = x_1x_2x_3\dots x_k$ for some $k \geq 2$ (since $T$ is connected), and each $x_i \in V(T)$.</p>

        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> $\text{deg}(x_k) = 1$.</p>

        <p>Clearly we have that $\text{deg}(x_k) \geq 1$ since it is at least adjacent to $x_{k-1} \in P$. Suppose for contradiction that 
            $x_ky \in E(T)$, and $y \neq x_{k-1}$. This can then be handled in two cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case 1:</strong> $y \in P$... if this is the case then $y = x_i$ for some $i \in \{ 1,\dots,  k-2\}$. Then we can construct a cycle $x_kx_ix_{i+1}\dots x_{k}$ which contradicts the fact that $T$ is acyclic.</li> 
                <li><strong>Case 2:</strong> $y \notin P$... if this is the case then $P' = x_1x_2\dots x_ky$ is a longer path than $P$ which contradicts the fact that $P$ was maximal.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>$\blacksquare$</p>
