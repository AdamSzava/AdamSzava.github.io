        <h2>Column Rank Equals Row Rank</h2>
        <p><em>Posted on: 07-25-2025</em></p>

        Given a matrix $A$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{F} \in \{ \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}\}$, we can define it's column and row ranks as follows.

        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Definition:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>The column rank of $A \in \mathbb{F}^{m,n}$ is the dimension of the span of the columns of $A$ in $\mathbb{F}^{m,1}$.</li>
                <li>The row rank of $A \in \mathbb{F}^{m,n}$ is the dimension of the span of the rows of $A$ in $\mathbb{F}^{1,n}$.</li>
                


            </ul>
        </div>
        
        In this post we follow <em>Axler's LADR-4e</em> in proving the following theorem...

        <div class="proposition">
            <strong>Proposition 1:</strong> Suppose $A \in \mathbb{F}^{m,n}$, then the column rank of $A$ equals the row rank of $A$.
        </div>

        Before we prove this theorem, let's set this up a bit. The significance of this theorem is the fact that they are always equal allows us to talk about the "rank" of a matrix without specifying which one. We begin with the following theorem which we state without proof, although the proof is a simple application
        of the definition of matrix multiplication.
        <div class="theorem">
            <strong>Theorem:</strong> 
            Suppose $C \in \mathbb{F}^{m,c}$ and $R \in \mathbb{F}^{c,n}$.
            <ul>
                <li>Column $k \in \{1,\dots, n\}$ of $CR$ is a linear combination of the columns of $C$ with coefficients coming from column $k$ of $R$.</li>
                <li>Row $j \in \{1,\dots, m\}$ of $CR$ is a linear combination of the rows of $R$ with coefficients coming from row $j$ of $C$.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        The main result of this post relies heavily on the existence of a <em>column-row</em> factorization of a matrix $A$. We prove this now.
        <div class="proposition">
            <strong>Proposition 2:</strong> Suppose $A \in \mathbb{F}^{m,n}$, and column rank $c \geq 1$, then there exists a $C \in \mathbb{F}^{m,c}$ and $R \in \mathbb{F}^{c,n}$ such that $A = CR$.
        </div>
        <p><em>Proof of Proposition (2):</em></p>

        First, we construct $C$. Take the list of columns of $A$ and call it $L$:
        $$L = A_{\cdot, 1},\dots, A_{\cdot,n}$$
        $L$ is a spanning list for the column space of $A$, and so it can be reduced to a basis $L'$ of the space. This basis necessarily has length $1 \leq c \leq n$. Recall $A$ has $m$ rows.
        We can construct the matrix $C \in \mathbb{F}^{m,c}$ by using the elements of $L$ as the columns.

        <p>Second, we construct the matrix $R$. We want to use the first point from the <em>Theorem</em> stated above. We will construct $R$ in such a way that column $k \in \{1,\dots, n\}$ of $A$ is a linear combination of the columns of $C$
        with coefficients coming from column $k$ of $R$, in which case we have $A = CR$. Indeed, this can be done because the columns of $C$ are a basis for the column space of $A$, so indeed there is a unique set of coefficients in $\mathbb{F}$ such that column $1 \leq k \leq n$ of $A$ is a linear 
        combination of the $c$ columns of $C$. Therefore we will have $c$ coefficients for the $n$ columns in $A$. These $c$ values can be arranged into columns to form $R$.</p>

        <p>$\blacksquare$</p>

        Now that we know the existence of such a factorization for all matrices, we can prove the main theorem of this post, which I will restate below. Also relevant is the definition of the matrix transpose.

        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Let $A \in \mathbb{F}^{m,n}$, then define $A^t \in \mathbb{F}^{n,m}$ such that:
            $$(A^t)_{k,j} := A_{j,k}$$
        </div>

        <div class="proposition">
            <strong>Proposition 1:</strong> Suppose $A \in \mathbb{F}^{m,n}$, then the column rank of $A$ equals the row rank of $A$.
        </div>
        <p><em>Proof of Proposition (1):</em></p>
        Let $c$ denote the column rank of $A = CR$ (where $CR$ is it's column-row factorization, $C \in \mathbb{F}^{m,c}, R \in \mathbb{F}^{c,n}$).

        <p><em>$\text{column rank of }A \geq \text{ row rank of }A$</em>:</p>

        We show the inequality by showing that the row space of $A$ is spanned by at most $c$ vectors. By the second point from the <em>Theorem</em> stated above, we have that the every row of $A = CR$ is a linear combination of the rows of $R$, there are $c$ rows in $R$
        and so we know there is a spanning list for the row space of $A$ of length $c$. Therefore we have that the row rank of $A$ (which is the dimension of the row space of $A$, as in the length of the basis that can be obtained by reducing the $c$ rows from $R$) $\leq c =$ the column rank of $A$.
        

        <p><em>$\text{column rank of }A \leq \text{ row rank of }A$</em>:</p>
        
        An analogous process can be done for $A^t$, showing that:
        $$\text{row rank of }A^t \leq \text{ column rank of }A^t$$

        Combining this with the fact that the row rank of $A^t$ is equal to the column rank of $A$, and vice-versa, we are done.
        
        <p>$\blacksquare$</p>
